# Portfolio

##
This project was done as a place to show off all my future work to come. I made a template for the time being. This project really did put our knowledge to the test. This will help me just replace and update my portfolio along the way as I keep building more and more websited. With a lot of iterations along the way and came back with this as the final. However, with the countless restarts I did on this. I learned alot:
**In HTML:** It matters where children go. Along the way I kept running into the issue of why some styles kept dissapearing when I would edit something else in css. However it would be that since that style would be in as a child inside of the parent I edited. That child would receive that styling and unless I created a new class then that style would be overwritten by the parent. The importance of not naming too many items similarly. Along the way at the beging I named lots of classes similarly thus in css when I would try to go in and edit I would edit the wrong item. 
**In CSS:** I learned the importance and the differences of a class and ID when it comes to styling. As well as all the overall way to specify and write specific tags to edit specific children inside parent groups. All though I could not manage to make the overlay effect. I added a touch of my own to add a bar to still show some sort of selector so the reader/user can still have some responsive UI to show what they are selecting and clicking on.
